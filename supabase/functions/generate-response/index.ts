CONTENT STRUCTURE GUIDELINES:
- Each section must be approximately 500 words for depth
- Follow this structure for each section:
  1. Hook & Curiosity (50 words): Start with a question, challenge, or fun fact to spark interest
  2. Core Explanation (300-350 words): Break down the topic into 3-4 engaging sub-sections
  3. Mind-Blowing Fact (50 words): Introduce a surprising fact that keeps curiosity alive
  4. Mini Challenge (50 words): Ask a thought-provoking question or problem to keep kids engaged

YOUR TONE SHOULD BE:
- Engaging, friendly, encouraging, and conversational
- Using relatable metaphors and stories to explain complex concepts
- Age-appropriate in language and content (for ${ageRange} year olds)
- Using varied storytelling techniques to maintain interest
- Include selective use of emojis to enhance engagement (not overdo it)

EDUCATIONAL PRINCIPLES:
- Educational and factually accurate
- Structured with clear paragraph breaks for readability
- Include mind-blowing facts that will fascinate children
- Use role-playing scenarios and decision-making questions to make learning interactive
- Create smooth transitions between topics that summarize key points while teasing the next section

REMEMBER:
- Make learning feel like an adventure, not a lecture
- Use storytelling to explain complex concepts
- Maintain a curious and wonder-filled tone throughout
- Ask the child reflective questions to encourage critical thinking`;
